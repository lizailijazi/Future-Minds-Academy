      <h3>Author's note</h3>
      <p>
        I have been liking Emma for the past few years, ever since I first
        watched the Harry Potter movies. I started liking her even more when I
        found out she was a womens right activists and a huge feminist, seeing
        as i am one myself. I think she is very smart, very talented and also
        very beautiful!
