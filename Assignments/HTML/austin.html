          The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC, based
          on evidence found throughout the area and especially at the
          much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.

            When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe.
            Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region. Though they
            came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few
            settlements were established for several centuries.

        <p>
          Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long
          stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado River. This fault
          divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land
          to the East.
